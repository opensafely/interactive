# Open SAFELY Interactive

This is the GitHub repository used by <https://interactive.opensafely.org> to manage the analyses it creates.

It is a little different to standard OpenSAFELY repositories. Each OpenSAFELY
Interactive analysis request is added as an isolated commit to the main branch,
and is run using that commit. The HEAD of `main` shows the last analysis that
was created, but you can see all previous analyses by looking at the commit
history.


# About the OpenSAFELY framework

The OpenSAFELY framework is a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) for electronic
health records research in the NHS, with a focus on public accountability and
research quality.
